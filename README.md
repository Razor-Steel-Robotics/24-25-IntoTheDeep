# Game
In INTO THE DEEPSM presented by RTX, two competing ALLIANCES collect deep sea SAMPLES to score in their
NET ZONE or BASKETS, work with HUMAN PLAYERS to create SPECIMENS to score on the CHAMBERS of the
SUBMERSIBLE and ASCEND from the depths before time runs out.

During the first 30 seconds of the MATCH, the ROBOTS operate autonomously. Without guidance from their
drivers, the ROBOTS score SAMPLES in their BASKETS or NETS, or SPECIMENS on the CHAMBERS. They can
collect additional SAMPLES to score in BASKETS or make them into SPECIMENS and PARK before the end of the
period.

During the remaining 2 minutes of the MATCH, human drivers take control of their ROBOT. ROBOTS collect and
sort SAMPLES from under the SUBMERSIBLE in the center of the FIELD. The yellow SAMPLES are scored in the
BASKETS and the ALLIANCE SPECIFIC (i.e., elements owned or associated with a specific ALLIANCE) red and
blue SAMPLES are returned to the OBSERVATION ZONE for the HUMAN PLAYERS to collect.

HUMAN PLAYERS can pick up SAMPLES delivered to the OBSERVATION ZONE and add a hanging CLIP to
create a SPECIMEN. SPECIMENS can then be returned to the OBSERVATION ZONE on the FIELD where
ROBOTS can pick them back up and score them on the CHAMBERS located on the SUBMERSIBLE.

As time runs out, ROBOTS can either PARK in the OBSERVATION ZONE or race back to climb the RUNGS on the
SUBMERSIBLE so they can ASCEND out of the deep.
The ALLIANCE that earns the most points wins the MATCH!
